# learn-c
Learn the C Programming Language! Now in an easy-to-use format which can be worked on offline. This tutorial is still being worked on, but feel free to look through what has already been written!

Made with Trillium.

## Getting started

This course is made to be as accessible as possible, as simple as possible, and as quick as possible all while being as informative as possible. To get started, all you will need is VI, which is the text editor we will be using -- also, you will need the C Compiler, `gcc` (or `clang`). Most distros of MacOS and Linux come with VI or VIM (VI Improved), and gcc should come with Linux (installing it on MacOS is really easy).  

If you can, **do not use Windows!**
