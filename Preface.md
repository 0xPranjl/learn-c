# Preface
Welcome to the course on the C language. Before we start, let's see what we can use C for.

*   Machine Learning
*   Application Writing
*   Operating System Writing
*   Manipulation of Computer Memory
    *   This is something that's really useful. This is also something a lot of languages cannot do.
*   Basics for other languages
    *   Here are some other languages that you can learn after this:
        *   Python
        *   C++
        *   Java
        *   JavaScript
        *   C#
    *   There are other languages, but I didn't mention them because they are probably not good. The point is, C is, as Will Smith would say, the “Ground Zero”.

Whenever you are tasked with writing a piece of code, try writing it down on a piece of paper before. Don't just read my code and follow along.
