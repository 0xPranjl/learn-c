# 2.1 Functions
A function, as we said earlier, is a tool. It's a tool that takes in an input, and spits something out. Let's take a simple function twice, which takes in an integer and prints out twice that value.

Visually, this is what it does:

The twice function.

It takes in i and spits out two times i. Let's look at the code behind it.

    int twice(int i) {
    	i *= 2;
    	return i;
    }

This may seem confusing; but before we break down this function, let's look at other functions we have written in the past. That's right: I'm talking about the main function that is omnipresent in your code. Compare the main function below to the code above:

    main() {
    	printf("This is a function\n");
    }

There are a few differences. For one, double has “int” written before it. What's the deal with that? Well, when writing a function, you should always keep the data type you expect it to return before. So, because i is an integer, and twice an integer is still an integer, double() will return an int. This is called the return type.

> Note: You're probably thinking: Should I have specified the return type for `main()`? The answer is yes. Even if you don't, however, the code will compile – as it did earlier. The warnings you may have seen earlier were because you didn't specify the return type. In the future, you can specify the return type as int, even if you don't return an int.

What's in the parentheses? Well, unlike the main function, we can pass things in. In this case, we pass in a variable, i. When I call double from another function, say, the main function, I can pass in a value – however, since the value will change, depending on what you call, we just use i. Let's write a full program that works with our function.

    #include <stdio.h>
    
    /* evens.c: print all even numbers from one through twenty */
    
    int twice(int);
    
    int main() {
    	int n;
    	for(n = 0; n <= 10; n++)
    		printf("%d ", twice(n));
    }
    
    int twice(int i) {
    	i *= 2;
    	return i;
    }

Functions are a lot to wrap your head around. Let's break this code down.

    int twice(int);

Whenever you write a function, it is always good to declare it at the top of your code, between the `#includes` and the main function. While you don't _technically_ need it, it's pretty standard for programmers to put this up there. We do this for multiple reasons:

1.  If we take a break from writing, we know what functions we have yet to implement
2.  We define what the return type of the function is and what we pass in
3.  If we write our own header file (like stdio.h), we will need these. A lot.

Notice I didn't name the int that was getting passed into twice. That's because you aren't actually calling the function; you're just specifying details about it. It's read as _“a function named twice, which takes in an integer and returns an integer.”_ 

    int main() {

The main function is a function, despite not usually returning anything. I chose to specify it as int, even though it doesn't return anything. Alternatively, you could have set the return type to `void`, which basically means it won't return anything.

> Note: If you read other people's code, you may notice that they add a `return 0` at the end of the main function. This basically means that the code did what it was supposed to do and executed successfully.

    for(n = 0; n <= 10; n++)
    	printf("%d ", twice(n));

We already know what the for loop does. Because the twice function returns an int, and %d is just a placeholder for an int, I can just set %d as the placeholder. But that's not all! I can also do the following:

    int variable = twice(2) /* declare an int that is equal to the output of twice */
    return twice(some_variable); /* returns the output of twice: ONLY works with functions whos return types are of the type int */
