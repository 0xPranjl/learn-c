# 2.4 Memory Allocation
Suppose I do a simple initialization and calculation.

    int myVariable;
    myVariable = 3 * 4;

This calculation goes through a pretty rigorous process. First, it allocates some area in memory for this integer named myVariable. How much? Well, e Now, when I refer to memory, what could I be referring to? The hard drive? The RAM (Random Access Memory)? The temporary storage space in the CPU? Well, I'm referring to the RAM. 

It goes to the CPU, where the value is calculation is done and is temporarily stored. The CPU is like our scratch paper; nothing important is stored there and anything stored there, including calculations, are disposed of. From there, the value in the CPU (12) is moved into the memory space allocated for myVariable. This is stored there for future use until the end of the program, at which point that memory becomes free to write over again.

RAM is temporary; it resets every time you restart your machine. However, some valuable things may be stored in RAM, including links you have copied and other “garbage values” – integer values put into place by
